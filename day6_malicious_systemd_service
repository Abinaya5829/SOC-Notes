# Malicious systemd service:
It used by attackers to maintain persistence on compromised Linux systems, allowing them to execute malicious payloads even after reboots.

# Attacker goal:
Attacker aim is to establish the malicious payloads into compromized system it runs automately when the system reboot.

# How the attack works:
Attackers can create or modify the service files like /etc/systemd/system/ or /lib/systemd/system/.
It successfully excecute into the compromised system and run it when the system get stratup.
The malicious script can execute the unauthorized access to attacker. but the systemd service can execute always when the system stratup/reboot.

#  Normal behaviour:
Legitimate systemd services are well-documented, have clear names, and execute known binaries or scripts located in standard directories.
They are managed by system administrators and are essential for system operations (e.g., sshd.service for SSH access).

# Suspicious behaviour:
Malicious service files have unuasal names in non standard location.and it execute script that perform unexpected actions.Services executing binaries
from /tmp, /home, or hidden directories.

# The evidence:
The service enumeration involues to identify active services and look for suspicious.analysis the log, service file investigation and do behavioral analysis. 
Enumerating enabled services using: systemctl list-unit-files,Service unit files(/etc/systemd/system/, /lib/systemd/system/, Logs from /var/log/syslog)
