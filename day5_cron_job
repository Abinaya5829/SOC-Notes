# Attacker Goal:
Attackers can try to persistence with automated execution to gain access and compromised to the system for executing cron jobs.
After they get a access to sensitive area from the system. and they execute their payloads and malicious activities without manual.

# How the Attack Works:
Attackers gain the access and compromised the system. they execute the malicious script into the system files/path and modify the existing file.
after the cron can create the backdoors for attacker. it can command at specific interval to attacker.

# Normal Behavior:
cron job are used for legitimate user. it execute the automate process at specific interval( system backups,cleaning temp files and etc)
basically it used the crontab file. it specify the command to run and schedule.

# Suspicious Behavior:
The presence of cron jobs that execute scripts or commands not recognized by system administrators.
the cron job can modify the existing file without user knowledge.

# The evidence:
The creation and modification of cron jobs(/etc/crontab, /etc/cron.d/, /var/spool/cron/crontabs/, crontab -l)
File modification timestamps. excution patterns of cron job can be flagged for investigation(wildcard injection,path hijacking).
